# Firefox Privacy Enhancer

This is a .js file that can be used to change some settings in Firefox to improve privacy and security. Firefox checks and uses this preferences based on the **prefs.js** file. You should not edit the prefs.js file. Instead you can create a **user.js** file and modify settings there. Firefox will read user.js and use those values instead.

### Important!

Remember to always back up your information before meddling with stuff. I recommend creating a testing profile to first test these options and check if it works for your browsing habits. They may break some websites
